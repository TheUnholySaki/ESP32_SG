  OK, ya ready for some fun? HTML + CSS styling + javascript all in and undebuggable environment

  one trick I've learned to how to debug HTML and CSS code.

  get all your HTML code (from html to /html) and past it into this test site
  muck with the HTML and CSS code until it's what you want
  https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro

  No clue how to debug javascrip other that write, compile, upload, refresh, guess, repeat

  I'm using class designators to set styles and id's for data updating
  for example:
  the CSS class .tabledata defines with the cell will look like
  <td><div class="tabledata" id = "switch"></div></td>

  the XML code will update the data where id = "switch"
  java script then uses getElementById
  document.getElementById("switch").innerHTML="Switch is OFF";


  .. now you can have the class define the look AND the class update the content, but you will then need
  a class for every data field that must be updated, here's what that will look like
  <td><div class="switch"></div></td>

  the XML code will update the data where class = "switch"
  java script then uses getElementsByClassName
  document.getElementsByClassName("switch")[0].style.color=text_color;


  the main general sections of a web page are the following and used here

  <html>
    <style>
    // dump CSS style stuff in here
    </style>
    <body>
      <header>
      // put header code for cute banners here
      </header>
      <main>
      // the buld of your web page contents
      </main>
      <footer>
      // put cute footer (c) 2021 xyz inc type thing
      </footer>
    </body>
    <script>
    // you java code between these tags
    </script>
  </html>
